## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key (can be obtained from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KNIGHTABDO/gemini-agentV1.git
cd gemini-agentV1
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîß Usage

1. Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# On Windows
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# On macOS/Linux
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Alternatively, you can provide the API key when prompted.

2. Run the agent using the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Or launch the web interface:

```bash
python main.py --web
```

4. Interact with the agent:
   - Type your questions or commands
   - Type `debug` to toggle debug mode (shows detailed logs)
   - Type `reset` to clear the conversation history
   - Type `web` to launch the web interface from command line
   - Type `exit` or `quit` to end the session

## üß† How It Works

The agent processes user input in the following way:

1. The user's message is sent to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model
2. The agent parses the response to identify if any tools need to be executed
3. If tools are requested, the agent executes them and gathers the results
4. The tool results are sent back to Gemini for analysis and to generate a final response
5. The agent extracts the main response, removing any "thinking" sections or tool request markers
6. The final, clean response is presented to the user

### üîç Web Search Capabilities

The agent includes powerful web search functionality:

- Searches multiple engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- Automatically extracts and processes content from top search results
- Stores screenshots of search results and page content for reference
- Handles failures gracefully with fallback mechanisms

### üìÅ File Creation

The agent can create files based on your requests:

- Code files with appropriate syntax highlighting
- Text documents with formatted content
- Markdown files for documentation
- JSON, XML, and other data formats
- Files are saved in the OUTPUTS directory

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending with New Tools

The project uses a flexible tool architecture that makes it easy to add new capabilities:

1. Create a new class that inherits from the `Tool` base class in `tools.py`
2. Implement the `name`, `description`, and `execute` methods
3. Register your tool in the `Agent` class by adding it to the tool registry in the `__init__` method

Example:

```python
class WeatherTool(Tool):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "weather"

    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Get weather information for a location"

    def execute(self, location: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implementation here
        pass

# Register in Agent.__init__
self.tool_registry.register_tool(WeatherTool())
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

### üìö Document Analysis

The agent can read and analyze various document formats:

- **Supported Formats**:

  - PDF files (.pdf) - For reading articles, papers, and reports
  - Text files (.txt, .text) - For simple text content
  - Word documents (.docx) - For formatted text documents
  - PowerPoint presentations (.pptx) - For slides and presentations
  - Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx) - For tabular data and workbooks
  - CSV files (.csv) - For structured data in comma-separated format

- **Usage Methods**:
  - **Web Interface**: Upload documents using the file upload component
  - **Command Line**: Drag and drop file paths directly into the terminal
- **Analysis Features**:
  - Extract and summarize content from documents
  - Answer questions about document content
  - Provide metadata information (page count, slide count, etc.)
  - Handle different encodings and formatting
  - Present structured data in a readable format

## üîß How To Use Document Analysis

### Via Web Interface

1. Launch the web interface:

   ```bash
   python main.py --web
   ```

2. Use the file upload component:

   - Click "Browse" to select a document (PDF, DOCX, TXT, XLSX, PPTX, CSV)
   - Optionally add a specific question about the document in the message box
   - Click "Upload & Analyze"

3. The agent will:
   - Process the document
   - Extract text content based on the file type
   - Provide information about its contents
   - Answer any specific questions you've asked

### Via Command Line

1. Launch the command-line interface:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Drag and drop a document file directly into the terminal, or type/paste the full file path

3. The agent will detect the file path, validate the file type, and analyze its contents

4. You can ask follow-up questions about the document's content in subsequent messages

### Example Document Analysis Queries

- "Summarize this PDF document for me"
- "Extract the key points from this presentation"
- "What are the total sales figures in this Excel file?"
- "Find all mentions of 'climate change' in this document"
- "Convert this CSV data into a markdown table"
- "What are the main sections of this document?"

All analyzed files are safely stored in the UPLOADS directory for future reference.
